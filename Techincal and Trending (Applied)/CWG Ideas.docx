2. Real-world / Ransomware insipired simulations 




HL, TECHNICALLY SPECIFIC IDEAS
(Area 1) Protocol Packet Injection
- (something other than modbus)
- Challenge: intercept and manipulate the communications between a PLC and HMI (or other devices) to change the actuator and process behaviour; undetected (?)
- Goal: extract a flag from a specific manioulated state of the PLC/device
