Ideas for techincal operations in terms of raising awareness around OT Security through CWG

Both for personal learnings and for developers and clients



FOCUS AREAS
1. (Legacy) Protocols
2. Real-world / Ransomware insipired simulations 
3. Networking (convergence, segmentation, architecturing, etc.)
4. Misconfigurations and vulnerabilities (in devices, CVEs, otherwise)
5. Industrial engineering devices and techincal awareness (i.e. SCADA, EMS, and DCS environments with components like PLCs, RTUs, etc.)
6. EWS and HMI exploitation (essentially web-apps)





HL, TECHNICALLY SPECIFIC IDEAS
(Area 1) Protocol Packet Injection
- (something other than modbus)
- Challenge: intercept and manipulate the communications between a PLC and HMI (or other devices) to change the actuator and process behaviour; undetected (?)
- Goal: extract a flag from a specific manioulated state of the PLC/device

Ladder Logic Tampering
- Challenge: 

(Area 3) Network Segmentation Bypass
- Challenge: Pivot from corporate net to segmented ICS zone 
- Goal: access a panel/historian or something else (tamper with data?) 
- How: simulate network env (Mini CPS?)
