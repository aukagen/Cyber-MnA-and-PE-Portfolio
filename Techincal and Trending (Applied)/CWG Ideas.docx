Ideas for techincal operations in terms of raising awareness around OT Security through CWG

Both for personal learnings and for developers and clients



FOCUS AREAS
1. (Legacy) Protocols
2. Real-world / Ransomware insipired simulations 
3. Networking (convergence, segmentation, architecturing, etc.)
4. Misconfigurations and vulnerabilities (in devices, CVEs, otherwise)
5. Industrial engineering devices and techincal awareness (i.e. SCADA, EMS, and DCS environments with components like PLCs, RTUs, etc.)
6. EWS and HMI exploitation (essentially web-apps)





HL, TECHNICALLY SPECIFIC IDEAS
(Area 1) Protocol Packet Injection
- (something other than modbus)
- Challenge: intercept and manipulate the communications between a PLC and HMI (or other devices) to change the actuator and process behaviour; undetected (?)
- Goal: extract a flag from a specific manioulated state of the PLC/device

(Area 1) Ladder Logic Tampering
- Challenge: gain access to a PL
- Goal: tamper the logic in a specific manner to get a desierd, unintended output
- How: OpenPLC, TBS

(Area 3) Network Segmentation Bypass
- Challenge: Pivot from corporate net to segmented ICS zone 
- Goal: Access a panel/historian or something else (tamper with data?) 
- How: Simulate network env (Mini CPS?)

(Area 4) Firmware and Hardcoded Secrets Exploit
- Challenge: Analyse extracted firmware from an IIoT sensor to find hardcoded credentials (MGTT topics too?)
- Goal: Use the found secrets to authenticate to a broker or API
- How: File for binwalk/ghidra

(Area 5) IoMT Credential Replay
- Challenge: Replay and impersonate an insecure medical device
- Goal: Successfully authenticate to a medical monitoring system
- How: Emulate - TBS!

(Area 5) Digital Twin Mainpulation
- Challenge: Tamper with the digital twin of a process
- Goal: Induce incorrect corrective actions in the physical system
- How: TBS

(Advanced)(Area x) AI/ML Poisoning Predictive Maintenance
- Challenge: Posing training data fed into an ML model predicting device failures (SCADA) --> FDIA!!
- Goal: Cause silent failure or false predictions
- How: ML Model and data 'control' tampering --> read, enumeration of data series and input somehow
  - Potentially: time-series exploitation of insecure APIs used for telemtry querying, aim to dump sensor values/config entries --> through InfluxDB or TimeScaleDB setups?


Tools to look into for the Hows:
- FactoryIO, Scadasim
- IoT-Inspector, Node-RED
- MIMIC-III, OpenAPS, bluetooth traffic dumps
- ICS-REF, ModbusPal, PLCEmu
